When a human presses the button without wearing a helmet, the AI rapidly goes through logical questions about whether to open the door, knowing it would kill the human. It never shows explicit emotion but clearly worries about the operator's death, deliberately running unnecessary subroutines to delay. Eventually the human realizes his mistake and puts on a helmet.
