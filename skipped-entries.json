      "reason": "These are cyborgs (modified humans) who retain their biological brains. The entry explicitly states 'Androids 17 and 18 are actually cyborgs, thus A.I. isn't exactly applicable to them.' They are humans with cybernetic enhancements, not AI."

      "source_section": "anime_and_manga",
      "reason": "This entry is a philosophical discussion about the nature of AI sentience, not a specific character. The entry 'Deconstructed in Pluto, which proposes that it has to be a crapshoot or else it's not a true A.I.' discusses the manga's thesis that unpredictability/flaws are necessary for true sentience, but doesn't identify a specific AI character that went rogue. Too abstract to be a character entry."
