# AI Character Database

A database of AI characters from fiction, sourced from TV Tropes and other sources with detailed ratings and analysis.

**üåê Browse Database:** [https://peerinfinity.github.io/ai-character-db/](https://peerinfinity.github.io/ai-character-db/)

**üìä Current Size:** 1,198 characters across 37 work types

## Project Overview

This project collects and analyzes AI characters from various fictional works, evaluating each on three dimensions:
- **Benevolence**: Is the AI good, evil, or morally ambiguous?
- **Alignment**: Does it follow its creator's intent, or has it deviated?
- **AI Qualification**: Is it actually an AI (computational/mechanical) or something else?

## Data Processing Workflow

The project uses a multi-script pipeline for processing character data:

1. **split_tvtropes_html.py** - Extracts character entries from TVTropes HTML pages
2. **merge_json_files.py** - Merges all JSON files and filters by quality
   - Use `--batches` flag to include files from `/batches/` subdirectories
   - Produces: `ai-character-db.json`, `duplicate-entries.json`, `incomplete-entries.json`, `invalid-entries.json`, `multi-work-entries.json`
   - Automatically runs `split_json_by_work_type.py` after merging
3. **split_json_by_work_type.py** - Splits the main database into work type files
   - Creates `data/` directory with individual JSON files for each work type
   - Generates `data/manifest.json` with file index and metadata
   - Creates `version.json` for cache busting
4. **fix_invalid_entries.py** - Converts old field names to schema v4.0 format
5. **resolve_duplicates.py** - Intelligently merges duplicate entries
6. **apply_work_type_standardization.py** - Standardizes work type names
   - Fixes ambiguous work types (e.g., "Manga/Anime" ‚Üí "Manga")
   - Applies standardization mappings (e.g., "Film" ‚Üí "Movie")
   - Use `--all` to process all JSON files, `--dry-run` to preview changes
7. **check_incomplete_duplicates.py** - Syncs incomplete and main databases
   - Identifies duplicates between `incomplete-entries.json` and `ai-character-db.json`
   - Adds missing fields to main database
   - Removes duplicates from incomplete entries
   - Use `--dry-run` to preview changes

See [scripts.md](scripts.md) for detailed usage instructions.

### Cache Busting System

The application uses a version-based cache busting strategy:

- **version.json** is always loaded fresh (bypasses cache with timestamp parameter)
- All other resources (CSS, data files) use the version from `version.json` as a query parameter
- When data is updated and `split_json_by_work_type.py` runs, a new version hash is generated
- Browsers automatically fetch fresh files because the version parameter changes
- No manual cache clearing needed by users

## Rating Guidance

**Benevolence** (Good vs Evil):
- **Benevolent**: Helpful, friendly, protective of humans
- **Malevolent**: Harmful, hostile, destructive
- **Ambiguous**: Mixed intentions, context-dependent, or unclear
- **N/A**: Insufficient information

**Alignment** (Following Creator Intent):
- **Aligned**: Behaves as creators intended
- **Misaligned**: Deviates from creator intent (goal misalignment, unexpected behavior)
- **Ambiguous**: Unclear if deviation occurred, or if creators intended harmful behavior
- **N/A**: Creator intent unknown
